# OpenAI-mountainCar-v0
### Application of Q-Learning algorithm to the OpenAI mountainCar-v0 environment. ###
The Q-Learning algorithm is implemented in the q_learning.py file. The formulas for the algorithm are taken from the Sutton and Barto book.
The main file (main.py) is in charge of running the algorithm and storing important data such as rewards per episode. It also creates a video of the rewards per episode with respect to time, so we get a better sense of how quickly the algorithm learns. A video that I created is in the .avi file.
